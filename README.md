# Computer-Networks

Overview

This course is an introduction to computer networks and is suitable for undergraduates and beginning graduate students. The course will investigate computer networks and network protocols from both a conceptual and implementation standpoint. The primary focus of the course will be on foundational ideas, architecture, protocols and software used in networks that comprise the Internet. Expect us to cover the majority of the topics in the Peterson and Davie text (see details below). Major topics of this course will include:

Protocol layers and other design principles
Physical and data link layer protocols
Naming and addressing
TCP/IP implementation
Internet routing
Congestion control
Applications
Network security
Wireless and cellular networks
(Mobile) Web
